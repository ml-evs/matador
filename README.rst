matador is an aggregator, manipulator and runner of first-principles calculations, written with a bent towards battery electrode materials.
The source can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/ml-evs/matador>`_ and online documentation is hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://docs.matador.science>`_.

Example Jupyter notebooks and tutorials can be found `online <https://docs.matador.science/en/latest/examples_index.html>`_ or in the ``examples/`` folder of the matador source code.

Installation
------------

In the simplest case, ``pip install matador-db`` is sufficient to get up and running, preferably in a fresh virtual environment. More detailed instructions can be found in the `Installation instructions <https://docs.matador.science/en/latest/install.html>`_.

Usage
------

For basic command-line usage, please explore the help system for each sub-command. Common workflows can be found inside ``examples/`` and in the `online docs <http://docs.matador.science/en/latest/examples_index.html>`_.

Please consult the full `Python API documentation <http://docs.matador.science/en/latest/modules.html>`_ for programmatic usage.

    MATerial and Atomic Database Of Refined structures.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit

    subcommands:
      valid sub-commands

      {stats,query,import,hull,voltage,changes,hulldiff,swaps,refine}
        stats               print some stats about the database.
        query               query and extract structures from the database
        import              import new structures in folder into database
        hull                create a convex hull from query results (currently
                            limited to binaries and ternaries)
        voltage             plot a voltage curve from query results (currently
                            limited to binaries and ternaries)
        changes             view database changelog or undo additions to database
                            (NB: not deletions!)
        hulldiff            diff two convex hulls with the --compare flag.
        swaps               perform atomic swaps on query results
        refine              update structures in the database according to
                            specified --task

Core functionality
-------------------

The core functionality can be summarised by the various sub-commands of the
command-line interface above. The API has many more features that can be explored
in the examples and API documentation.

- Scraping of CASTEP (and Quantum Espresso) input/output files into flexible Python dictionaries/models.
- The creation and curation of MongoDB collections of geometry optimisation, calculations, with a powerful querying CLI/API.
- Customisable, publication-ready plots for all models, e.g. phase diagrams, PDF, PXRD, voltage profiles, electronic/vibrational bandstructures etc.
- Automated high-throughput geometry optimisations, electronic and vibrational properties using CASTEP (and Quantum Espresso) with ``run3``. Tested on several supercomputers.
- Creation of phase diagrams and electrochemical voltage profiles from the results of DFT calculations.
