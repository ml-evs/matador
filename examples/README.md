# Examples

This folder contains an assortment of examples, some as Jupyter notebooks and
some as tutorials to be followed according to the text files within. 

A full explanation, with links to the appropriate Binder can be found in the
[Examples section](https://docs.matador.science/en/stable/examples_index.html)
of the online documentation.

Examples in the `./interactive/` folder can be run without any external data,
either locally or with Binder. Those in the `./non-interactive/` folder require
external data but provide useful code snippets.
