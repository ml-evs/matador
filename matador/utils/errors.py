    uncorrectable has happened! Plays more nicely with multiprocessing than
    SystemExit.

    """Raise this when there is an issue with the input files."""


class WalltimeError(RuntimeError):
    """Raise this when you don't want any more jobs to run
    because they're about to exceed the max walltime.

    a calculation that another node is performing.
